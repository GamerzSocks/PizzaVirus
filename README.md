# Pizza Virus
This is a tiny passion project to figure out what i can make using my coding knowledge that i have been learning this year. It is called the "Pizza Virus" and simulates a very bad domino's pizza delivery page.

It is written in python, however, i may port it to other languages once i can.

As for a licence, i have written a custom one. You can find it under the LICENCE.md file i will soon add.
However, this is a Computer Virus, it may not be dangerous, but it can be very annoying to clean up once it is complete.

# Disclaimer
This is not really a "harmful" virus, at worst, in the future, i may implement a BSOD. However, make sure you have consent if using it on others.
This is made for fun, not to wreck computers.
